# MCQ-Program

The Python script here does a fun quiz using a file called 'quiz-data.json' which has all the questions and their correct answers. When you run the script, it asks if you're ready to play. If you say yes, it shows you questions, and you pick an answer from the choices. It keeps track of your score and tells you if you got each question right or wrong. Finally, it shows your total score. It's like a simple game where you answer questions and see how well you did.
